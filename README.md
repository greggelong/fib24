# fibonacci 24 repeating pattern

## Fibonacci 24 repeating pattern after reduction to single digit

I learned about this pattern from a rather spiritual math Insta post

it linked to the web site:

The claim is if you do a numeric reduction on the fibonacci sequence

the pattern will repeat after 24 numbers.

I am using an iterative fibonacci generator, because it is faster and I think more

intuitive than a recursive one (however most times recursion is taught using fibonacci as an example!)

However, what I thought was a neat little problem to solve is the reduction

for example take the number 256, 

split into a list [2,5,6]

sum that list= 13

split into a list [1,3]

sum that list = 4

so 256 = 4

Some interesting questions came to mind

how big would the number have to be that you would need to do the reduction 

3 times or more
